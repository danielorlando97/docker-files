## üê≥ Collection of DockerFiles

---

**Skills**: `Docker` `Dockerfile` `DockerCompose` `Makefile`

### Motivation

This repo arises from the need to collect the basic configurations of the multiple infrastructures
I have worked with in order to reuse them easily. I always prefer to use dockerized infrastructures,
for me they are easier to operate and configure.
